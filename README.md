# Work portfolio

- **1-dockerized-neo4j-graph:** Docker container with a simple graph showing the courses dependencies in the IDM program at
TecnolÂ´ogico de Monterrey. In the readme file, there are instructions to build the image from the Dockerfile and to run a
container with the graph.
- **2-dockerized-ml-model:** Docker container with a logistic regression model for the Titanic dataset. Good practices of writing
code have been followed with the help of the libraries pycodestyle and pyment. In the readme file, there are instructions to
build the image from the Dockerfile and to run an inference of the model.
- **3-pyspark-experiments:** Two examples using PySpark: 1) a pipeline that extract, transform and persist data, and 2) a
notebook that performs distributed grid search for an ARIMA model.
- **4-anomaly-detection:** This notebook explores the performance of typical machine learning models used in binary
classification in detecting anomalies for four different scenarios. To improve performance of the models, resampling methods
have been used with positive results.
